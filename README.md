# CMSI-281-Algorithms

## Algorithm paradigms with an emphasis on combinatorial search. Topics include: generating combinatorial objects; greedy methods, dynamic programming; randomized algorithms; modern heuristics such as genetic programs and simulated annealing; advanced sorts and order statistics; cake-cutting and fair division; graph algorithms; computational geometry.

### Projects coded in Java

#### Bucket Sort
Takes a dataset of doubles and BucketSorts them (Insert Sort is also used for individual buckets).  

#### Crown and Anchor
Monte Carlo simulation of the card game Crown and Anchor
Simulation has the option to change the total number of simulations (args[0]) and the amount of money bet each simulation (args[1]).

#### Math Methods
Manual implementation of various math algorithms for popular math functions. Implemented recursively and iteratively.

#### Select
Takes a dataset of integers plus int k, and outputs the kth smallest number in the dataset.


#### Sumo Solver
Solves the following problem:   
Sumo wrestler Keiry≈ç needs to put on weight in a hurry. With money in hand, he heads to a specialty food store where he is confronted with many items, each of which has a cost (in dollars) and a guarantee of the weight (in pounds) that he'll gain if he eats that item. His dilemma is which items to buy so as to maximize his total weight gain.
Solved with recursive memoization.
